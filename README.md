# Welcome to the Blog Aggregator
We're going to build an RSS feed aggregator in Go! We'll call it "Gator",
you know, because aggreGATOR üêä. Anyhow, it's a CLI tool that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the
full post


RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can
use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and
more!

## Prerequisites
The project assumes that you're already familiar with the Go programming
language and SQL databases.

## Learning Goals
- Learn how to integrate a Go application with a PostgreSQL database
- Practice using your SQL skills to query and migrate a database (using sqlc
and goose, two lightweight tools for typesafe SQL in Go)
- Learn how to write a long-running service that continuously fetches new posts
from RSS feeds and stores them in the database
